# LOGO

[What is LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) (Wikipedia):

```
Logo is an educational programming language, designed in 1967 [...]]

A general-purpose language, Logo is widely known for its use of turtle graphics, 
in which commands for movement and drawing produced line or vector graphics [...]
The language was conceived to teach concepts of programming [...] where students 
could understand, predict, and reason about the turtle's motion by imagining what 
they would do if they were the turtle.
